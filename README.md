## recipe2 ##
a command line tool for recipes and shopping lists
#### Introduction ####
why I switched to the store schema idea
Also, why GRM won't work for every shopping scenario and why more utilities must exist. (think sublists, multiple stores, and mucinex)
#### Description of Problem ####
write me.
#### Proposed Solution ####

#### Shopping List Algorithm ####
description.
#### Example Toolchain Scenario ####
Example: I want to prepare a weeks worth of freezer meals for my family. So I begin by generating a shopping list using [Gourmet Recipe Manager](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet). I want to make one of every dish in my database and 2 slow cooker green bean sides:

So I generate a shopping list:

and format it slightly and print it: (future developments might include using Gourmet Recipe Manager's sqlite database directly)

Now that the list is printed firmly onto the original computational device: paper; I can proceed and order it according to the Shopping List Algorithm described in detail on the wiki. **PUT A LINK HERE**.
