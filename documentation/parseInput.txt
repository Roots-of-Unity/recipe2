///for processing command line arguments to my project: I have some thoughts
///1. Roll my own parser
///   Criticism: I don't have enough time to read and study this subject too much. I'd prefer to
///   read someone else's docs and learn while I go. This points to a library solution. Also,
///   I'd rather move onto implementing the unique parts of my program.

///From these links:

///   https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3jwkgt/libraries_for_modern_c/

///I've learned of the existence of these options for processing command line arguments:
///   Docopt has a C++ port: http://docopt.org/
///   https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts
///   http://optionparser.sourceforge.net/index.html
///   GNU Getopt(). This isn't cross platform.
///   boost::program_options

///   Docopt seems nice but it seems to be out of the scope of the course. I'm more open to
///   a solution that is closer to c++

///   That axiom leaves 3 remaining: boost, cxxopts, and optionparser.

///   I have no idea how optionparser doesn't utilizes any standard library features for C or C++. So I'm playing
///   The ignorance card and backing away from that one. (Plus, the docs seem a little sparse)
///
///   Now choice is between boost and cxxopts:
///   After reading about cxxopts vs boost::program_options here:
///   https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3jwkgt/libraries_for_modern_c/
///   (expand all comments and search that page for instances of: cxx)
///   I think that cxxopts is more within the scope of the assignment and course than boost
///   It's header only, and I don't have to spend as much time figuring out how to install and bundle
///   across platform.
///   Blog post where cxxopts was created: https://thenewcpp.wordpress.com/2014/10/13/lightweight-c-options-parser/
///   It's requirements are a C++11 compiler.
